1) The data is taken from keggel.
2) The dataset contains google stock price from 2004 to 2023.
3) There is no nan value in the dataset.
4) Feature scalling has been done through StandardScaler() that means mean-centering and scaling by factor of standard deviation.
5) Then i have perform multiple linear regression using LinearRegression().
6) Then applied the regularized version of the linear regression Lasso , Ridge and then Elasticnet which incorporate L1 norm , L2 norm and L1 and L2 norm respectively.
7) Then applied multiple polynomial regression.
8) Then gradient descent algorithms
9) Then normal equation.
10) Then applied SVD.
